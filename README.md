# Getting Started with Your TypeScript Todo App

Welcome to your TypeScript-based Todo App, bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

- Launch the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in your browser.
- The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
- You might also see lint errors in the console, which helps ensure code quality.

### `npm test`

- Start the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- For more information, see the **running tests** section.

### `npm run build`

- Build the app for production in the `build` folder.
- It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include hashes for caching.
- Your app is now ready to be deployed!
- For more details, check the **deployment** section.

### `npm run eject`

> **Warning**: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back!

- If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
- This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.
- After ejecting, all the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will reference the copied scripts, allowing for customization.
- You are not required to use eject. The default setup is suitable for most projects and will cover most use cases.
